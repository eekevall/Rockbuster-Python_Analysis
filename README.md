# Rockbuster-SQL-Analysis
Descriptive data analysis project using SQL to interrogate the data.

## Project Overview
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.

Rockbuster Stealth’s business intelligence (BI) department whose remit covers helping other departments, from inventory to customer insights, with data-related queries have asked for help with the launch strategy for the new online video service.

After loading Rockbuster’s data into the PostgreSQL relational database management system (RDBMS) SQL was used to analyse the data, address the key objectives and answer the key business questions.

### Key Questions and Objectives
The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has asked a series of business questions and they expect data-driven answers that they can use for their 2020 company strategy. Here are the main questions they’d like to answer:
* Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
* What was the average rental duration for all videos?
* Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
* Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
* Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

### Data Analysis Tasks
* Create a data dictionary
* Summarise and clean the data
* Filter and query the data
* Join tables of data, perfom subqueries and write common table expressions (CTE)
* Analyse the data
* Create visualisations communicating insights for stakeholders
* Present findings

### Tools
The SQL analysis was carried out using PostgreSQL in pgAdmin 4.<br>
The results of the queries were exported to Excel and analysed in Tableau.<br>
The final presentation was compiled in Keynote and converted to a PDF.<br>
